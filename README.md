This is a simple web development that generates a random password depending on the selected properties. 
These are length of password, uppercase characters, lowerchase characters, numbers from 0-9, and some 
special characters.

For the program to work, user needs to select the length and check the password properties. Once button 
is clicked, a password would be generated based on the selected properties.
